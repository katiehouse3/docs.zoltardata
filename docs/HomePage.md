# Zoltar Home page

The Zoltar [home page](https://www.zoltardata.com/) lists all of the projects in the archive. A *project* is a
collection of *forecast models* and their *forecasts*, and is described in more detail below. This page shows basic
project information, including name, owner, description, and (in the "Objects" column) a summary of the number of models
and forecasts in the project. (This number is an estimate.)

At the page's top is a header that's shown on all pages. It contains three icons: Home page (the Zoltar crystal ball in
the upper left), and on the right a user drop down menu and a help (question mark) icon on the far right. The drop down
menu's appearance depends on whether a user is logged in. If so then it's text is the user name and the menu items are
links to the user profile page, and a logout item. If the user is not logged in then "Sign in" is shown. Clicking it
takes you to a typical login page where you specify your account's user name and password.

Clicking a project name takes you to its detail page.

Creating projects: Any logged in user can create projects via the "New" button towards the top. Clicking it will take
you to a form where you can fill in the details described below.
