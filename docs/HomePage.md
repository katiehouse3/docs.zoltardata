# Zoltar Home page

The Zoltar home page [zoltardata.com](https://www.zoltardata.com/) lists all of the projects in the archive. A *project*
is a collection of *forecast models* and their *forecasts*, and is described in more detail below. The home page shows basic
project information, including name, owner, description, and (in the "Objects" column) a summary of the number of models
and forecasts in the project. (This number is an estimate, but may include actual row counts.) Currently the site looks
something like this:

![Zoltar Home page](img/HomePage.png "Zoltar Home page")

At the page's top is a header that's shown on all pages. It contains three icons: Home page (the Zoltar crystal ball in
the upper left), and on the right a user drop down menu and a help icon (question mark) on the far right. The drop down
menu's appearance depends on whether a user is logged in. If so then it's text is the user name and the menu items are
links to the user profile page, and a logout item. If the user is not logged in then "Sign in" is shown. Clicking it
takes you to a typical login page where you specify your account's user name and password. (To obtain an account, please
[contact us](index.md#contact).)

From this page you can:

- Log in to your account (see the note above).
- Click on a project name to go to its [detail page](ProjectDetailPage.md).
- Create a project. (Any logged in user can create projects via the "New" button towards the top. Clicking it will take
  you to a form where you can fill in the details described below.)
